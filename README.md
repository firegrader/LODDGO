# LODDGO

LODDGO is a simple, live raffle app for schools and organizations.
Inspired by the energy of Kahoot, but built for digital raffles.

Core principles:
- No accounts required for participants
- Phone number used only as a temporary user reference
- Live, transparent draws
- Simple MVP first, scalable later
